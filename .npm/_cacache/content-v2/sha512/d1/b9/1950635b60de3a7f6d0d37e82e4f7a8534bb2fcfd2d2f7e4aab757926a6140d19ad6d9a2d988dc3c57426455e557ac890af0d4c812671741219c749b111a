yaot [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/anvaka/yaot.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/anvaka/yaot)\n\nOctree in javascript. Extremely fast module to query points in 3D space. Can\nbe used to find points under mouse cursor in 3D scene.\n\n# usage\n\nThis module is best suited for static scenes, where points are not changed\nover time. To get started initialize the tree:\n\n``` js\n// First we need to create the tree:\nvar createTree = require('yaot');\n\nvar tree = createTree();\nvar points = [\n  0, 0, 0, // First point at 0, 0, 0\n  10, 0, 0 // second point at 10, 0, 0\n]\ntree.init(points);\n\n// Now we are ready to query it:\n// Which points lie inside sphere with center at 0, 0, 0 and radius 2?\nvar matches = tree.intersectSphere(0, 0, 0, 2);\n// matches[0] === 0 -> the point at first index of `points` array is there!\n\n// Let's extend our sphere:\nvar matches = tree.intersectSphere(0, 0, 0, 20);\n// matches[0] === 0 -> Point at index 0 is here too\n// matches[1] === 3 -> Point at index 3 from `points` array also inisde\n```\n\nYou can also query points which lies inside octants intersected by a ray. This\nis very useful when you want to know which points lie under mouse cursor.\n\n``` js\nvar rayOrigin = {\n  x: 1, y: 0, z: 0\n};\nvar rayDirection = {\n  x: -1, y: 0, z: 0\n};\nvar matches = tree.intersectRay(rayOrigin, rayDirection)\n\n// If you want to limit where ray starts checking against intersection\n// you can pass option `near` argumnet:\nvar near = 10; // by default it is 0, but could be made bigger!\nvar matches10PixelsAway = tree.intersectRay(rayOrigin, rayDirection, near);\n\n// You can also limit upper bound by setting `far` argument:\nvar far = 100; // By default it is positive infinity, which matches all.\nvar matchesPointsBetween10And100Pixels =\n    tree.intersectRay(rayOrigin, rayDirection, near, far);\n```\n\nTo see how to use it with three.js please read about demo below.\n\n# demo\n\nA three.js demo is available [here](http://anvaka.github.io/yaot/demo/octree.html) ([src](https://github.com/anvaka/yaot/blob/master/demo/octree.js#L104)).\nYou can compare its performance to native three.js [`raycaster.intersectObjects()`\nmethod](http://anvaka.github.io/yaot/demo/raycaster.html) ([src](https://github.com/anvaka/yaot/blob/master/demo/raycaster.js#L103)).\nOpen dev console on both pages to see the timers. Octree solution is 42 times faster than\nnative `raycaster.intersectObjects()`.\n\nVideo comparison is available here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Z-Yzb-WSKg\n\nKeep in mind that raycaster is generalized solution which works with any three.js\nobjects, while octree is very much specialized.\n\nThis module is also used in the [code galaxies](http://anvaka.github.io/pm/).\nSource code is [here](https://github.com/anvaka/unrender/blob/master/lib/hit-test.js).\n\n# install\n\nWith [npm](https://npmjs.org) do:\n\n```\nnpm install yaot\n```\n\n# license\n\nMIT\n","maintainers":[{"name":"anvaka","email":"anvaka@gmail.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2022-06-29T06:58:14.325Z","created":"2015-08-05T05:18:01.681Z","1.1.0":"2015-08-05T05:18:01.681Z","1.1.1":"2015-08-10T21:39:38.878Z","1.1.2":"2015-08-12T18:37:41.570Z","1.1.3":"2015-08-15T00:38:12.474Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/anvaka/yaot#readme","keywords":["quadtree","octree","oct","tree","octrie","quadtrie"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/anvaka/yaot.git"},"author":{"name":"Andrei Kashcha"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/anvaka/yaot/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md","users":{"defmech":true}}
